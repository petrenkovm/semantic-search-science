Recent studies in biomedical informatics show that integrating structured clinical data with unstructured text from electronic health records enhances predictive modeling. Techniques like entity linking and concept normalization allow researchers to map patient narratives to standardized vocabularies such as SNOMED CT and UMLS. This fusion of data modalities opens new possibilities for early disease detection and personalized treatment planning.
