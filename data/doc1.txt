Transformer-based models have revolutionized natural language processing by enabling context-aware representations of text. Unlike traditional bag-of-words approaches, transformers capture semantic relationships across long sequences. Fine-tuning pre-trained models like BERT or RoBERTa on domain-specific corpora significantly improves performance in tasks such as question answering, named entity recognition, and semantic similarity.
