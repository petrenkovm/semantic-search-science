Semantic search systems leverage dense vector representations to retrieve documents based on meaning rather than keyword overlap. Sentence transformers encode queries and documents into the same embedding space, allowing for efficient similarity comparison using FAISS or other nearest neighbor algorithms. This approach is particularly effective in domains with synonym-rich or jargon-heavy language, such as legal or scientific texts.
